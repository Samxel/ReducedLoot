**Not every chest needs to feel like a jackpot.**

Reduced Loot cuts down the amount of items found in naturally generated loot chests across all structures – from vanilla dungeons to modded fortresses – bringing scarcity, balance, and challenge back to exploration-heavy modpacks.  
Whether you're raiding a Bastion or looting a Waystone hut, you'll find less loot, but every item will matter more.
